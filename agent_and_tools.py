    SeeScreen is a powerful visual perception tool that allows the agent to observe the current screen context

    a multimodal LLM to extract a detailed description of what is visually present, including UI elements,
    open windows, visual cues, and text content.

    This tool is especially useful for agents needing to:
    - Understand the current user interface
    - Respond to visual prompts on the screen
    - Monitor workflows, apps, or web pages in real time
    - Provide contextual assistance based on what the user is viewing

    Agents are strongly encouraged to call this tool **whenever screen context is important**, 
    especially when decisions, suggestions, or actions depend on what is being visually displayed.
